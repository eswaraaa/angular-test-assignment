# Angular 8 Application with Github API
## Use-Case

- After the app is launched, the **Search** component is displayed
- The user enters a random String value into to the 'Login' field and clicks the 'Submit' button
- The app sends a http request to `https://api.github.com/search/users?q={login} in:login`, where {login} is the String value entered by the user
- The app then parses the response from the server. If data is returned, the **Results** component should display the fetched values. If there is an issue with the request, then an error message should be displayed.

Some news source saying like "There's no fourth stimulus check, but many will get $1,800 before 2021 ends"


Previous rounds of COVID stimulus payments sent money to families in the order of $1,200, $600, and $1,400 - the last one being part of the American Rescue Plan signed into law by President Biden in March of 2021. The American Rescue Plan also sent money directly to families in the form of the expanded federal Child Tax Credit. The first half of the newly expanded credit is being delivered directly to families.
