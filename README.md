# Angular 8 Application with Github API
## Use-Case

- After the app is launched, the **Search** component is displayed
- The user enters a random String value into to the 'Login' field and clicks the 'Submit' button
- The app sends a http request to `https://api.github.com/search/users?q={login} in:login`, where {login} is the String value entered by the user
- The app then parses the response from the server. If data is returned, the **Results** component should display the fetched values. If there is an issue with the request, then an error message should be displayed.
